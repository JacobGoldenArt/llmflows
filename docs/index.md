## About
LLMFlows is a framework for building simple, explicit, and transparent LLM applications.

## Installation
```
pip install llmflows
```

## Where to start

After installing `llmflows` with `pip`, your go-to destination should be the user 
guide. Each page helps new users gradually learn LLMFlow starting from simple concepts, 
going through all main abstractions, and ending with complex use cases where LLMFlows 
shines. 

Each page has a TL;DR code snippet to copy, paste and move on. If you already have 
significant experience with LLMs and prompt engineering, or if you are in a rush, feel 
free to use the TL;DR section and the API reference when needed.

If you are new to LLMs and prompt engineering, feel free to go through the user guide 
in the specified order where you can learn
about concepts, abstractions, and patterns when creating LLM-powered applications. 

We hope you find this documentation helpful and look forward to your feedback on how 
we can improve it.


## Philosophy

### Simple
Our goal is to build a simple, well-documented framework with minimal abstractions that 
allow users to build flexible LLM-powered apps without compromising on capabilities.

### Explicit
We want to create an explicit API enabling users to write clean and readable code while 
easily creating complex flows of LLMs interacting with each other.

### Transparent
We aim to help users have full transparency on their LLM-powered apps by providing 
traceable flows and complete information for each app component, making it easy to 
monitor, maintain, and debug.
