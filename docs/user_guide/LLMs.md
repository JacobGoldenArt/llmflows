## TL;DR

```python
from llmflows.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI()
result = llm.generate(prompt="Generate a cool title for an 80s rock song")
print(result)

## Guide
LLMs are one of the six main abstractions in LLMFlows. LLMs classes are wrappers around LLM APIs such as OpenAI's APIs.
LLMs provide methods to set up and call these APIs, retry calls in case of failures, as well as methods to manage and format the responses. 

!!! info

    All LLM classes can be imported from `llmfwlos.llms`

```python
from llmflows.llms import OpenAI
```

One of the most widely used LLMs is OpenAI's `GPT-3` which is available through their completion API. LLMFlows's `OpenAI` class is a wrapper around this API.
It can be configured in the following way:

```python
llm = OpenAI(
    model="text-davinci-003",
    temperature=0.7,
    max_tokens=500,
    max_retries=3,
)
```

All LLM classes have a `.generate()` and `.generate_async()` mehtods that are used for generating text.
In order to generate text with `"text-davinci-003"` the only thing we need to provid is a `prompt`.

```python
result, call_data, model_config = llm.generate(prompt="Generate a cool title for an 80s rock song")
```

The `.generate()` method will return the text completion, information related to the call it made to the OpenAI's API, 
and the config that was used to make the call

```python
print(result)
```
```commandline
"Living On The Edge of Time"
```
```python
print(call_data)
```
```commandline
